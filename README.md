# sMule
šMule is edk2 (EDonkey) p2p client

This is just for fun, it was build intended to replace the Lithuanian made closed source analogue zMule (eMule fork). šMule does the same but with full source code. Users/Developers can create their own MLDonkey servers and adapt this client to suit their needs.

It's prepared and adapted for Visual Studio 2010 with solution, so you only need to download source, open it with VS2k10, build and run.
